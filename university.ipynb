      " Among the 10 colleges located in Worcester, Mass., Worcester Polytechnic Institute stands out as a close-knit private school grounded in scientific education. The student body is actively engaged in campus activities, such as the rivalry contests like the gigantic tug-of-war held throughout the year that pit the freshmen class against the sophomores.  than 30 percent of students are members of the school's 15 or so fraternities and sororities. Even more - close to 70 percent - are involved in campus sports at some level. The WPI Engineers compete in the NCAA Division III New England Men's and Women's Athletic Conference, supported by mascot Gompei, a goat. Though the original school mascot was the head of a once-live goat, the school now uses a man-made replica for a mascot. WPI students also come out in droves for the school's club sports and intramural program, and all students must take four physical education courses, ranging from lifeguarding to plyometrics. Freshmen do not have to live in campus residence facilities, which include standard dormitories and four houses with student-selected themes. A university seal is imprinted on the ground in the center of campus, but make sure not to step on it; school lore warns that any student who does won't graduate on time. Off campus, students can use Woo Cards to get discounts on food and activities around Worcester. Boston is 45 miles away, or about an hour's trip by train.                                                                          :  1  \n",

The student body is actively engaged in campus activities, such as the rivalry contests like the gigantic tug-of-war held throughout the year that pit the freshmen class against the sophomores.  than 30 percent of students are members of the school's 15 or so fraternities and sororities. Even more - close to 70 percent - are involved in campus sports at some level. The WPI Engineers compete in the NCAA Division III New England Men's and Women's Athletic Conference, supported by mascot Gompei, a goat. Though the original school mascot was the head of a once-live goat, the school now uses a man-made replica for a mascot. WPI students also come out in droves for the school's club sports and intramural program, and all students must take four physical education courses, ranging from lifeguarding to plyometrics. Freshmen do not have to live in campus residence facilities, which include standard dormitories and four houses with student-selected themes. A university seal is imprinted on the ground in the center of campus, but make sure not to step on it; school lore warns that any student who does won't graduate on time. Off campus, students can use Woo Cards to get discounts on food and activities around Worcester. Boston is 45 miles away, or about an hour's trip by train. \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Football is a particularly big attraction in the fall, as fans support the Auburn Tigers with the help of school mascot Aubie the Tiger. The Tiger sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and the influx of football fans makes Auburn the fifth-largest city in the state on game days. Pep rallies are held in the downtown Toomer's Corner, and the area is covered in toilet paper by fans after every big victory.

Auburn freshmen ease into the college transition through Camp War Eagle, a two-day, overnight summer orientation program. Transition help continues on Hey Day, an annual effort to get students to wear name tags and say hello to one another.

A public engineering and applied sciences school in Golden, Colorado, Mines has 14 academic departments, including Mechanical Engineering and Geophysics. The school also offers courses in the Liberal Arts & International Studies and Economics & Business departments. When students aren't studying, the school's location is ideal for outdoor recreation. Golden is 13 miles from the state capital of Denver and lies in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where students can bike, hike and climb. The campus also has a climbing wall for students to test their skills before attempting the Rockies. Cold-weather sports fans can partake in the annual Winter Carnival, a student-run affair packed with skiing and snowboarding at a local resort. The Mines sports teams, known as the Orediggers, compete in the NCAA Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which is mostly made up of other teams from Colorado. The school mascot is Blaster the burro, and a giant \\\"M\\\" emblazoned onto nearby Mount Zion signifies the school spirit. There are more than 140 student clubs and organizations, including seven fraternities and three sororities. First-year students are required to live on campus. Even the student newspaper, The Oredigger, is decidedly science based; sections include weekly roundups of new discoveries and a Geek of the Week feature. \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Housing is guaranteed for four years, and more than 60 percent of students choose to live on campus. The campus lies along the Hudson River, and New York City is a boat or subway ride away. The Stevens Ducks mainly compete in the NCAA Division III Empire 8 Athletic Conference, and, through the school's Adopt-a-Team program, all student athletes have a faculty mentor to help them juggle sports and school work. Incoming freshmen also do not have the hassle of buying a new laptop; each student is given a notebook computer with software configured to his or her major.

The student body is also active in faith-based activities. Each year, students lead Be The Change, a week of speakers, breakout sessions and events that give religion a global focus. Freshmen are required to live on campus and must also take two semesters of Chapel, attending worship services every Monday and Wednesday.

At Harvard, on-campus residential housing is an integral part of student life. Freshmen live around the Harvard Yard at the center of campus, after which they are placed in one of 12 undergraduate houses for their remaining three years. Although they are no longer recognized by the university as official student groups, the eight all-male \"final clubs\" serve as social organizations for some undergraduate students; Harvard also has five female clubs. \n",
